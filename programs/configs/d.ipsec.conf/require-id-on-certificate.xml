<para>When using certificates, check whether the IKE peer ID is present as a
subjectAltName (SAN) on the peer certificate. Accepted values are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> (the default) or <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>.
This check should only be disabled when using dpeloyed certificates that do not have
their peer ID specified as a SAN on the certificate. These certificates violate RFC 4945
Section 3.1 and are normally rejected to avoid a compromised host to assume the
IKE identity of another host. The SAN limits the ID's the peer is able to assume.
