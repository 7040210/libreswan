Attempt to create CHILD SA after a failed attempt - it hangs

- first attempt has proposal mismatch so should fail

- second attempt should be ok but, instead, hangs

Once this is fixed, ikev2-child-01-dh-pfs=no-downgrade=no and
ikev2-child-02-dh-pfs=yes-downgrade=yes should be updated to include
all cases (and this test deleted).
