NETKEY based test to verify AUDIT messages are logged by the kernel
for service startup and shutdown and IKE SA's and IPSEC SA's events.

This test MUST run with selinux enabled or else the selinux labels in
the audit log are different (eg unconfined). Since some have configured
test VMs with /etc/sysconfig/selinux disabled, force it in this test.

This test is for failure cases only. Note that IKEv1 does not perform
proper state changes on IKEv1 failures - so LAK_PARENT_FAIL calls
cannot be placed inside complete_v1_state_transition()

Note also that at least for IKEv1, while the initiator retransmits, the
responder never creates a state so it logs the retransmits is individual
audit logs.
