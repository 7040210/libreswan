east does not yet run libreswan. Road attempts OE, and installs a %pass.
east is then started and triggered by a packet and initiated OE to
road. Road must replace the %pass with the tunnel.

because both ends are private-or-clear, and the ping on east sends more
than one ping, both ends will trigger OE to each other.

NOTE: we end up with two states but one set of policies in the kernel ????
      This might cause problems if one of the two tunnels is deleted

NOTE: this test case no longer needs to wait for shuntlifetime= because
      the shunt is now immediately replaced when an IPsec SA that matches
      the (now obsolete) %pass is installed. Test can be updated later to
      not wait for a shuntscan check. The pluto shunt table entry
      is deleted. the netlink call to delete the kernel policy it cut
      short in the case of %pass shunts, since it auto-replaces already.
